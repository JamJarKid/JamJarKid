### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome
-----------

The name "JamJarKid" has an interesting backstory. During my A-Level physics classes, my teacher used to say that if he handed me a complex, ornate jam jar, I could describe everything about it â€“ its shape, volume, surface area, and any other calculation imaginable. But, if he asked me to open it, that would be a different story.
